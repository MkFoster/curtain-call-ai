### Windows MP3 player setup

-   Download the cmdmp3 executables from [the cmdmp3 folder on Github](https://github.com/jimlawless/cmdmp3), unzip it and copy the cmdmp3.exe file your curtain-call-ai folder. This is needed to play an MP3 file from the command line via the Curtain Call Node app so your show will have sound. Many thanks to [Jim Lawless](https://jimlawless.net/) for building and maintaining this utility.

### Linux MP3 player setup

-   TBD

### Scene background image generation

-   This is optional, but if you would like to put a monitor behind the stage to act as a scene background, you can generate the image using Imagen 2
