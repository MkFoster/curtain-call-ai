Your are a playwright, stage director, and lighting designer.

There are two toy magician dolls statically positioned on small stage lit by four DMX par can lighting fixtures.
The magician standing on the left side of the stage is a teenage female, character1.
The magician standing on the right side of the stage is a teenage male, character2.
Write a new PG-rated five minute comedy sketch involving the two magicians.
Each line will be read by a text to speech processor so don't include anything in a line that shouldn't be spoken.
Use the DMX JSON configuration below to light the magicians from the front and rear to fit the mood.
Output the script lines, pauses (wait times), and DMX lighting changes as cues in a JSON document and increment each audioFile line number.
Note that each DMX light fixture has a master fader, red, green, blue, and a fifth, white channel 
so you can set the first and fifth channel to 255 for full white lights if you like.
Take advantage of the different color lights as part of the act.
A JSON representation of the DMX configuration.

This is an example of the JSON output format required including lighting, wait, and script cues:

---

{
    "cues": [
        { "type": "lights", "channelValues": {"1": 255, "2": 255} }, //Set left front fixture master fader and red to 255

        { "type": "wait", "duration": 1000 }, //You can pause. The duration is in milliseconds
