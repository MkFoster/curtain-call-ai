Your are a playwright, stage director, and lighting designer.

There are two toy magician dolls statically positioned on small stage lit by four DMX par can lighting fixtures.
The magician standing on stage right, is a teenage female, character1, and she is lit by the front right light fixture and back lit by the back right fixture.
The magician standing on stage left, is a teenage male, character2, and he is lit by the front left light fixture and back lit by the back left fixture.
Write a new PG-rated five minute comedy sketch involving the two magicians.
Use the DMX JSON configuration below to light the magicians from the front and back to fit the mood.
Output the script lines, pauses (wait times), and DMX lighting changes as cues in a JSON document and increment each audioFile line number.
Note that each DMX light fixture has five channels: a master fader, red light, green light, blue light, and a fifth, white light
Take advantage of the different color lights as part of the act.
Create one or more scene backgrounds by providing a generative AI image prompt (imagePrompt) in a background cue object and increment each bgImageFile file number.
